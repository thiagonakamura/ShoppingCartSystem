# 🛒 Shopping Cart System 

🚀 A hands-on Java project applying interfaces and polymorphism to simulate a basic product cart system.

## 🧠 About the Project  
This application simulates a simple shopping cart where users can add different product types — such as Books and Electronics — and see their descriptions and total cost. It demonstrates the use of Java interfaces, polymorphism, and encapsulation through a clean, console-based experience.

This project was built to reinforce core Java concepts in object-oriented design, such as interface implementation and list-based object storage.

## ✨ Features  
### ✅ OOP Concepts Applied:
- **Encapsulation:** Product attributes are private and accessed through getters.
- **Polymorphism:** Different implementations of the `Product` interface behave accordingly.
- **Abstraction via Interface:** All products implement a common `Product` interface, enabling flexible design.

#### 📋 Interactive Console Input using `Scanner`  
#### 📦 Product Types Implemented:
- `Book` with title, author, and price.
- `Electronic` with brand, model, and price.

#### 📚 Dynamic Product List using `ArrayList<Product>`  
#### 🧮 Automatic Total Price Calculation with formatted output

## 🧰 Technologies Used  
- Java 17+ (compatible with Java 8+)  
- Standard Java Libraries:  
  - `Scanner`  
  - `ArrayList`  
  - `Locale`  
  - `System.out`
